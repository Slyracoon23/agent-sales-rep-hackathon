Occasionally, I get a check without an invoice number, which can be a bit of a hassle to match up, but it's not a big enough issue for me to change my whole system.

What Truss Payments offers is a free service that integrates seamlessly with QuickBooks, allowing you to accept any payment method—credit cards, checks, ACH—without any processing fees. \n\nOne of the key benefits is instant settlement, so you get your funds immediately, which can be a game-changer for cash flow. We also offer mobile check deposit and automated matching with invoices, which could help with those occasional mismatches you mentioned. \n\nOur system is designed to enhance your current process without disrupting it, providing you with more flexibility and efficiency. Does that sound like something that might be worth exploring further?"

Anything else you think might change my mind?"

With Truss Payments, you could eliminate those trips to the bank with mobile check deposits, and the automated invoice matching could save you time on administrative tasks.\n\nAdditionally, our service is designed to be user-friendly and integrates smoothly with QuickBooks, so it wouldn't add complexity to your process. Plus, having instant access to funds could provide more flexibility for unexpected expenses or opportunities.\n\nHowever, if you're satisfied with your current setup and don't see a need for change, I completely respect that. If you ever decide to explore new options in the future, feel free to reach out. Thank you for your time, Mike, and have a great day!"
