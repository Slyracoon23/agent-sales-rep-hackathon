    },
    {
      "role": "sales_agent",
      "content": "Absolutely, I can provide you with pricing details. We offer a tiered pricing model based on the number of users. For your team of 15, we have a plan that includes all features for $15 per user per month. There are also discounts for annual subscriptions. Would that fit your budget?"
    },
    {
      "role": "customer",
      "content": "That\u2019s reasonable, but what about customer support? If we run into issues, how quickly can we get help?"

    },
    {
      "role": "customer",
      "content": "Yes, I think I\u2019d like to try it out first. Thank you for addressing my concerns, Alex."
    },

      "role": "sales_agent",
      "content": "You're welcome! I\u2019ll get that trial set up for you right away. I\u2019m confident you\u2019ll find our software beneficial for your team. If you have any further questions during the trial, feel free to reach out!"
