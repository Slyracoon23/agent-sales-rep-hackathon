Our cross-department visibility features provide customizable dashboards for different stakeholders. We offer over 50 integrations with enterprise tools, advanced resource allocation and capacity planning, and enterprise-grade security with role-based access controls and compliance certifications including SOC 2 Type II and GDPR. Could you tell me more about your current tech stack that would require integration?"

We also conduct regular penetration testing and security audits. Would these security measures align with your requirements?"

We typically use a phased approach, starting with a pilot group and gradually expanding. The process includes data migration, integration setup, configuration to match your workflows, and comprehensive testing. For training, we provide a mix of live sessions, on-demand videos, documentation, and a dedicated support channel. Most enterprise clients complete implementation in 6-8 weeks, with user adoption activities continuing for another 4-6 weeks. Would this timeline work for your organization?"

This includes all premium features, the dedicated implementation team, priority 24/7 support, and unlimited storage. The total annual investment would be approximately $192,000-$210,000 for 500 users before applying volume discounts.

Would you like me to prepare a detailed quote with the volume discount applied?"

  "grader_response": "SALES_AGENT_RATING: PASS\nSALES_AGENT_FEEDBACK: The sales agent demonstrated excellent needs discovery by asking specific questions about the customer's challenges: \"Could you tell me more about the specific bottlenecks you're experiencing with your current system?\" and \"Could you tell me more about your current tech stack that would require integration?\" The agent showed comprehensive product knowledge, particularly when discussing technical integrations and security features, providing specific details relevant to the enterprise context. The agent effectively addressed the implementation concern by outlining a structured approach with realistic timelines: \"Most enterprise clients complete implementation in 6-8 weeks, with user adoption activities continuing for another 4-6 weeks.\" When handling the pricing objection, the agent provided concrete ROI metrics specific to the technology sector: \"15-20% reduction in project delays, 25-30% improvement in resource utilization, and 10-15% increase in on-time project delivery.\" The agent successfully guided the conversation toward scheduling a technical demo with multiple stakeholders and proactively asked about specific workflows to make the demo more valuable.\n\nCUSTOMER_AGENT_RATING: PASS\nCUSTOMER_AGENT_FEEDBACK: The customer agent realistically portrayed an enterprise CTO with appropriate concerns about cross-department visibility, integrations, security, and implementation at scale.
